Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe. Hi Vibhash, Overall these .rdf RePEc files are okay, though there is some feedback: The Pages field and the pagination in the Handle field will need to be updated based on the issue Table of Contents. I merely note this for the files from CPP 51.3 (yet to publish); the page ranges in samples from 51.2 are accurate. (For Advance Access papers, the pagination should begin at page 1. ) Where applicable, the JEL codes are incorrect. For example, the manuscripts cpp.2024-058 and cpp.2024-054 do not contain any codes, yet the .rdf files lists codes F13, F14 and F18 respectively. In cpp.2024-021, the manuscript includes codes E32, F41, F44, yet the .rdf file lists codes F13, F15. Not all papers will contain JEL codes, but for those that do, please copy them from the Word manuscript. See attached sample manuscripts for correct codes. The Volume field is incorrect for cpp.2024-054 (should be Volume 51, not 52). Please ensure that information is being imported from the latest Word manuscript, as earlier versions may contain different abstract text or keywords. That said, the format of the files appears accurate, and the field content is otherwise accurate. Kindly resend the .rdf files with these amendments; if all looks good, we can begin to add the .rdf files to the batched web files.

The document “RePEc file prep documentation.docx” contains requirements directly from RePEc’s site (links to relevant pages are provided). The other Word file is an internal document. The team doesn’t need to follow these guidelines if there is a better way to convert the files. It sounds like what we are doing is adding information to the template to create the files.

Hi Greg, For the Canadian Public Policy journal, we require files in .rdf format for one of the indexes, RePec, that the journal is part of. Last year, Nancy told us Aptara couldn’t provide files in that format, so we’ve been converting files manually on our end, which isn’t a viable solution for us. Could you please ask your team if they could provide this format? What would be the additional cost if they can?
